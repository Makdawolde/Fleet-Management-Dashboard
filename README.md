# Fleet-Management-Dashboard
I designed and developed a fully interactive Power BI dashboard to optimize fleet operations by combining driver-level insights, KPI tracking, and advanced filtering. The solution integrates data from multiple sources (TMS, ERP, GPS) and transforms it into actionable intelligence for managers and executives.

🔹 Driver Analysis – Hover-enabled table showing total drives, average fuel efficiency, fuel cost per km, and driver speed.
 🔹 Fleet KPIs – Real-time metrics including Total Fix Cost ($2M), Fuel Cost ($550K), Maintenance Cost ($171K), 166K liters consumed, and 722K kilometers traveled.
 🔹 Trend Visualization – Interactive line chart tracking monthly, quarterly, and yearly changes across Total Fix Cost, Fuel Consumption, Maintenance, Kilometers, and Drives. 
🔹 Advanced Filtering – Custom panel to filter by truck type (BOX, SEMI-TRAILER, TRACTOR, TRAILER), trailer type (Dry, Fridge, Reefer), and KPI categories for deeper analysis.

💡 Impact: This dashboard empowers fleet managers to identify high-cost drivers, monitor efficiency trends, and reduce operational expenses while improving transparency and accountability.

🛠️ Technical Highlights: Built with Power BI, advanced DAX measures, and star schema modeling to deliver scalable, interactive reporting.
